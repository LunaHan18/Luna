       <p>Story 1
        As the island of Tuvalu gradually submerges underwater because of the sea level rise, the people of the island would relocate to New Zealand as a community. In fact, about a fifth of Tuvalu’s population of 12,000 have already relocated, many to New Zealand under the Pacific Access Category, a ballot that allows up to 150 citizens to be granted residence in New Zealand every year. However, many struggle to earn a living and are concerned about losing their cultural identity. We are proposing a data center in New Zealand that not only stores and manages dance notations as data into the metaverse, but also functions as a Tuvaluan community that gathers Tuvaluan people, provides spaces for rituals and dancing, establishes governmental regulations, and thus preserves what Tuvaluan people deem important – their culture and value.
        New Zealand has been a wonderful place for the industry of data centers as a relatively high proportion of New Zealand's electricity is generated by renewable energy resources. New Zealand’s moderate climate is also suitable for building data centers as less power is required to combat the heat generated by them. The excess heat and energy can also be used to fuel other communities and institutions like schools and hospitals through infrastructure. The availability of large areas of bare land means it is also comparatively cheap to acquire suitable sites, particularly in the South Island which, conveniently, is also home to New Zealand's main hydro-power dams.
        At times, Tuvaluan people would gather both physically and virtually to perform their fatele in the gathering space of the community data center. Motion capture technology and devices would capture their dance movement and record them according to the notational system we have developed. The recorded notations are then transferred into data, stored in the data storage or servers, and uploaded to the metaverse. As more and more notations are uploaded, the elements in the metaverse will keep growing and expanding accordingly. In this way, the metaverse is not merely a replica of their original living environment, but a cultural heritage expansion, a second life, or a digital twin that carries Tuvaluan people’s sovereignty.

        Story 2
        While countries and land worldwide are all suffering from the problems that the rising sea levels bring due to climate change, Tuvalu is particularly vulnerable. Therefore, an artificial infrastructure that allows metaverse to be generated and the living space to be floating will be a solution to sea-level rise.
        This raises crucial questions: Should elements of the physical world be conserved within the virtual realm? What implications does this hold for the cultural heritage of Tuvalu? Who should wield the authority in determining the metaverse's design?
        The infrastructure that we’re designing includes the lower part that’s firmly anchored on Tuvalu’s land, where locals will have spaces to record their culture and living freely, and the upper section is designed to float and rooms for the servers of the metaverse, alongside limited governance and living space for Tuvaluans.
        To start building the metaverse, sensors will be placed at various heights around the infrastructure to monitor sea level rise, tracking the real-world impact of climate change. This information will be sent to the system through signals, controlling how much space in the metaverse can be developed and used at the moment while the dancing process of fatele will influence the pace and speed of metaverse construction. Through this way, the action of Tuvaluans dancing fatele and the nature force will determine the growth and development of the metaverse. The notation that we created for fatele will be used as a medium that helps generate the dance movement translated into virtual space in the metaverse. The virtual space will be referred to and generated by body and hand movements and directions recognized by motion capture techniques. This encourages community engagement and cultural preservation while advancing the virtual space and letting Tuvaluans make the decision on how their future virtual nation looks according to the culture and traditions they have now.
        Once the sea level reaches its highest point on Tuvalu's land, and the upper section of the engineered infrastructure begins to float, the metaverse's growth and development will cease. This moment symbolizes a powerful and emblematic phase in Tuvalu's transition from the physical world to the virtual. The notion of a specific event triggering the transformation of a real location into a virtual one infuses the metaverse concept with depth and significance. It serves as a symbol of the impact of environmental issues in a virtual realm. The Fatele notation and the virtual spaces derived from it serve as vessels for preserving and celebrating Tuvaluan culture within the virtual world, establishing a dynamic and meaningful connection between the real-world challenges of climate change and the metaverse's virtual realm.
